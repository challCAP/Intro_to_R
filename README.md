Welcome to the Intro to R Github Repo!

We're excited to be with you on your journey to learning programming in R for data analysis!

This Github repository (or "repo" for short) is our shared drive where workshop materials will be posted for you to access & download on your local computer - think Google Drive for coders.

The README.md file (which you're reading right now) in each folder will help you navigate around our workshop's Github repo and include important links. Click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) for more information & tips on how to use Github.
