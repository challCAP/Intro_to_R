# Welcome to world of coding in R for Data Analysis!

################
## R Basics ## 
##############

### Get to know your RStudio ####

# A typical RStudio layout will have four panes:

## SOURCE pane - (top left pane or the one you're reading this in) here is where you will write/edit code

## CONSOLE pane - (bottom left) this shows the actual input/outputs into your computer.
  2+2 # press CMD+Return (CTRL+Enter for PC) on your keyboard at the end of this line to "run" it. Look at how the console updated

## ENVIRONMENT pane - (top right) this shows saved "objects" in your R "session"
  x <- 2+2 # run this line.
  # Notice, the answer didn't appear in the console, but 'x' now appears as a saved value in your environment
  x # now run this line. Because 'x' is a saved object, running it returns its value in the console.

# OUTPUT pane - (bottom right) we will mostly focus on the file and plot tabs, and will show how to use this pane in time

  
###################
## Vocabulary ####
#################

# COMMENT - putting '#' before text makes it a COMMENT, this is text that your interpreter will ignore when running a section of code
# SCRIPT - file type in RStudio interpreter which takes R commands, a new script = a new document
# WORKING DIRECTORY - the folder your script is currently running from (this is used for file pathing)
# OPERATORS - symbols R recognizes to perform specific mathematical, logical, or decision functions
# ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR - '<-' is an operator that assigns values to R objects
# ARGUMENT - Functions have unique arguments. Arguments go inside the parentheses following a function call to specify how the function should execute
  print('argument') # e.g. the argument you give the print function is the text you want it to print
  # arguments can be any data type, refer to a function's documentation to learn all arguments it can take

##################
## DATA TYPES ###
################

# There are three common data types: 

## NUMERIC - Set of all real numbers
value <- 3.14
class(value) # You can always check the data type using class()
  
## CHARACTER â€“ think of this as text. Any value surrounded by ' ' will be coerced to character type, also known as a string
string <- 'this is an example of character data type'
class(string)

## LOGICAL - This is a binary data type with two values: TRUE or FALSE
# NOTE: In R, logical values must always be written this way, aka True does equal TRUE
logical_value <- TRUE
class(logical_value)

# Logical values are used in condition statements
# Sample values
x = 4
y = 3
z = x > y
z # here the value of Z is TRUE because x is greater than y
  
# NOTE: there are three other recognized data types: integers, complex, and raw,
# but you most likely will not encounter these types, so we'll ignore them for now
  
################
## Objects ####
##############

## VALUE - stores single variable which can be any data type
x <- 4 # assigning value of 4 to object 'x'
x
length(x) # the length() function returns a numeric value equal to the number of elements in an object

x <- x + x # can assign the object x a new value using already stored objects
x # notice this has replaced the value of x
  
## VECTOR - stores series of data which are all the same data type
# the c() function means combine, it will combine comma-separated arguments into a vector.
# NOTE: All data points inside c() will be coerced to the same type.

v <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
class(v)
print(v)
sum(v) # if a vector is numeric, you can perform mathematical functions, like sum
mean(v) # or mean to find the vector's average


v <- c(1, 'two', '3', 4) # what data type will the vector v be?
class(v)
print(v) # notice how even though 1 and 4 are numeric inputs, the entire vector is coerced to characters

## LIST - stores series of data which can be different data types
# to create a list, use the list() function.
lst <- list(1, 2, 3, 4)
print(lst)

lst <- list(1, 'two', '3', 4)
print(lst)

# lists can also contain lists!

lst <- list(1, 'two', '3', 4, list(1,2,3,4))
print(lst)

## DATAFRAME - table-like object that stores 2 dimensional data relating rows with columns
# think excel speadsheet!

# Creating vectors for each column
name <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David")
age <- c(25, 30, 22, 28)
city <- c("New York", "London", "Paris", "Tokyo")

# Creating a dataframe using the data.frame() function
df <- data.frame(Name = name, Age = age, City = city)

# Displaying the dataframe
print(df) 

# Click on the arrow next to 'df' in your environment pane,
# you can see the column names, the data type of the column, and some data points
# Now click on df, this should open a tab with your dataframe if you ever want to look at it like a table


# NOTE: there are other recognized objects, but we're going to focus on these for now

## Mathematical Operators ###
############################

2 + 2 # addition operator

2 - 2 # subtraction operator

2 * 2 # multiplication operator

2 / 2 # division operator

2 ^ 2  # power operator

# others: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-operators/ 

#################################
## Logic & Logical Operators ###
###############################

TRUE # TRUE
FALSE # FALSE
# note: these have to be in all upper case

# Using logical operators will output TRUE or FALSE
2 == 2 # equals exactly
2 > 1 # greater than
2 >= 1 # greater than or equal to
2 < 1 # less than
2 <= 1 # less than or equal to
2 != 1 # exclamation point is the equivalent of "not", so this logical comparison is: 2 does not equal 1, which is TRUE

TRUE == TRUE
!TRUE == TRUE

# logical values also have mathematical values
TRUE == 1 # TRUE
FALSE == 0 # TRUE
TRUE + TRUE # 2
FALSE + TRUE # 1
TRUE * TRUE + TRUE # ?
TRUE * (TRUE + TRUE) # ?

## Logical operators can be combined using things like & (and), | (or), and xor() (exclusive of). This will combine
#  the logical conditions and output a logical vector that meets all of them, for example:
x <- 5
x == 5 & x > 2  # TRUE, x is both equal to 5 and greater than 2
x > 2 & x < 4  # FALSE, x is greater than 2 but is NOT less than 4
x > 2 | x < 4  # TRUE, x is greater than 2, one condition is met, so TRUE


#############################
## Indexing and Slicing ###
##########################

# Indexing and Slicing is an extremely important concept to managing data and developing functions.
# Like an index in the back of a book, R objects with multiple elements (think vector, lists, dataframes) have an index
# The index is the 'position' of where a specific element is within an object. Positional arguments in R are denoted by square brackets [ ]
# In R, the index starts at 1 (while this may seem intuitive, most languages start at 0)

lst <- list(1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,44,65)

lst[3] # this gives you the third value in the sequence
lst[length(lst)] # what does this code segment accomplish?

## Elements of a list or vector can also have names. Named lists can be
#  subset by their names. Dataframes are basically a list of named columns.

named_list <- list("dog" = 1, "cat" = 2, "human" = 3, "cow" = "grass", 'horse' = c('donkey', 5, 'Seabiscuit'))

# These elements can be accessed in the usual way using brackets OR they can be accessed using $, followed by the name. These two statements are equivalent:

named_list[[3]]
named_list$human
named_list['human']

# Notice, lists can also contain lists. Let's look into how to call information from a list within a list
named_list$horse
named_list[5]
named_list[[5]]

named_list$horse[1]
named_list[[5]][1]

## SWITH TO USING GOOGLE GEMINI (WE DO)
# In this section, I will walk through how I would approach a coding challenge if I encountered a task I didn't yet know how to do
# I'll demonstrate taking a task, prompting Gemini, and then interpreting the code to complete the task


## TASKS ##
## 1)  What is the last number in this list?

# My Prompt:
# In R, example of how to find the value of the last element in a list
# My Code
lst[length(lst)]

# Gemini Output
list_length <- length(lst)
last_element <- my_list[[lst]]
print(last_element)

## 2)  What is the second to last value in the list?

## My Prompt:
# While you could prompt Gemini again, read the output from your last prompt and see if you can figure our how to do this without prompting Gemini
# My Code
lst[length(lst)-1]

## 3) Subset the list to find the value of the elements in the first and third position

# My Prompt:
# In R, example of how to find the value elements in the first and third position
#
# My Code
lst[c(1,3)]

# Gemini Output
first_element <- lst[1]
third_element <- lst[3]
print(paste("First element:", first_element))
print(paste("Third element:", third_element))


## 4) Subset the list so the values in the first and third position are omitted
# My Code
lst[-c(1,3)] # Gemini Output same

## 5) Subset the list to repeat the value in the third position 3 times
# My Code:
lst[c(3,3,3)]

# Gemini Output
# Repeat the third element 3 times
rep(lst[3], 3)

## 6) Subset the list to get values from positions 1, 10, and 12 to 15
# My Code
y_long[c(1, 10, 12:15)]  # Gemini same


## Now switch to project-based learning (I DO)
## For this section, participants will be given a list of task with little guidance, they should use the concepts learned and
## prompting Gemini to complete the tasks

# Run the following code to import our dataset
install.packages('readr')
library(readr)

patient_intake_data <- read_csv("Desktop/GitHub/CAP/Intro_to_R/Session 1/patient_intake_data.csv")

# use a code segment to find how many observations are in the dataset?
nrow(my_data)

# use a code segment to find how many columns are in the dataset?
length(patient_intake_data)

# As is, use a code segment to find the first city that shows up in the dataset (row 1, column 2)
patient_intake_data[1,2]

# use a code segment to find the mean income of all observations in the dataset, find the median, and standard deviation
mean(patient_intake_data$Income)
median(patient_intake_data$Income)
sd(patient_intake_data$Income)


# use a code segment to find the mean income of only patients from Boston in the dataset, find the median, and standard deviation
# 
# Gemini Code:
# # Subset the data for patients from Boston
boston_patients <- subset(my_data, City == "Boston")

# Calculate the mean income for Boston patients
mean_income_boston <- mean(boston_patients$Income)

# Calculate the median income for Boston patients
median_income_boston <- median(boston_patients$Income)

# Calculate the standard deviation of income for Boston patients
sd_income_boston <- sd(boston_patients$Income)
