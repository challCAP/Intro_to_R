## Using R Basics

# What you're reading right now is a COMMENT, this is text that your interpreter will ignore when running a section of code
# COMMENTS are used to improve code readilibility and help organize sections of your code. use the '#' at the beginning or end of a line to
# start a COMMENT, such as the one at the beginning of this line,
# and this one.
# and this one.

#####
# Notice, if I use four '#' symbols to start a line, like I did just above, a carrot appears to left. Click on it and see what happens!
# Everything below it until the next section is hidden. Remember this as you start to write longer scripts to help with organization!
#####

# Now let's talk about actual code. Put your cursor to end of the next line and on your keyboard press CMD+Return (CTRL+Enter for PC)
print('Hello World')

# You should see "Hello World" was printed in the console below.
# Now lets see seem something slightly more interesting. Run the next line of code.
2+2
# Truly, we live in the future.

# You can also run multiple lines of code at the same time. Highlight the 4 lines of code below and press CMD+Return (CTRL+Enter for PC).
# Notice that only the print statement gives and output in your console, but the other lines of code ran.
